      "suprised to see the extensive bad reviews, I decided to see the movie for myself and judge it. It was a nice watch, brought out some social issues and challenged some beliefs like trust on godmen, blind faith, parents undying love for children...thus while it may not sit well with our preconcieved notions, it challeneges us to think why we have these beliefs in the first place? And whether they are actually universal truths or just more of generational beliefs that are passed on to us.....forming sort of an archetype in out psyche. At the very basic level the movie tries to drill into you the difference between following God and following Godmen, especially giving people the status of God, and taking their word as word of God....it's made it amply clear that protagonist is not against God but against people using name of God for their benefit... it's a realisation and awareness the socio-political situation perhaps really needs....The movie has good twists which come as a surpirse, and a decent story line. I love how they've incorporated scenes, songs, moments and dialogues from sadak as flashbacks to give a feeling of continuity and give depth to Sanjay Dutt's character. Also subtle things sprinkled across for movie buffs to pick up on. I do think the first 10 mins of the movie probably should have been shown as flashback and the movie should have started from the scene where alia comes to Sanjay dutt for the pre arranged booking and he denies.... But other than this, the movie was actually nice....My vote is pls see the movie for yourself and don't believe the overly negative reviews given. You will actually enjoy it especially as a conversation starter and thought provoker.\n",

      "No joke but Sadak 2 was really my most awaited film of 2020. As a school kid, I had bunked classes to watch the first part five times in its first week at Gemini cinema Bandra, my unbeaten record till date!! Featuring Sanjay Dutt as the sanki taxi driver Ravi who rescues his lady love Pooja Bhatt from clutches of the eunuch pimp Maharani, Sadak had terrific performances, Nadeem Shravan's extraordinary music and pulsating action in the climax which made it one of Mahesh Bhatt's most successful as well as memorable film till date. It is a perfect dose of entertainment for me - and I just love it.So naturally, I started watching Sadak 2 with high expectations- after all it had the legendary Bhatt Saahab returning to direction after twenty odd years, Sanju Baba and Pooja reprising their iconic roles with the current A lister Alia Bhatt added to the cast. And what did I get....Alia Bhatt screaming or hamming in every scene she appears, Sanju Baba largely ineffective with not even one good fight scene accorded to him, Pooja Bhatt heard (not even seen!!) as a ghostly voice who only Sanju can hear and a villain in form of Makarand Deshpande who cannot achieve even ten percent of what the late Sadashiv Amrapurkar did as the menacingly evil Maharani. Starting as a road trip for which Alia hires Sanju Baba as her cabbie, the inconsistent plot tries to cram in multiple characters and elements in to it. Aditya Roy Kapoor plays Alia's love interest who is falsely convicted by a fake godman (Deshpande). Alia, labelled a mentally unstable person, is running away from her parents who are andh bhakts of that godman. They keep chanting every single minute which gets irritating after a while. Somewhere in all this mess, there is good ole Gulshan Grover who claims to have chopped off his own hand to offer it to Jai Guruji. By the way, Grover is called Haathkata probably for this unique feat!!Truly, nothing makes sense in this sham of a screenplay penned by Bhatt Saahab where one phone call turns an otherwise scheming antagonist in to sympathising positive character and vice versa. Moreover, the music score, always his strong point, is absolutely pheeka here. Not a single song stays with you. I actually fast forwarded the last one thanking the Bhatts for taking this film digital instead of a theatrical release. Any positives then, you may ask? Well, the technical aspects are good enough. The production values are befitting an enterprise of this kind. And last but certainly not the least, Sanjay Dutt still commands a solid screen presence like he did in the 90s. Unfortunately, Sadak 2 doesn't do him any justice. Nor does it do any justice to its prequel lovers. Skip it.\n",

      "Over the course of five years, Vince Gilligan and his friends have constructed a world piece by piece, with attention to detail worthy of a Faberge egg. They created a compelling protagonist, a deeply flawed yet charismatic genius. They built a business at which he had savant-like skills, and depicted the family that often drove him crazy. Then blurred lines between the two. And in that way created a life for Walter White that many of us can relate to. But other great and groundbreaking TV dramas had done something similar, most notably David Chaseâ€™s The Sopranos, David Simonâ€™s The Wire, and David Milchâ€™s Deadwood. But Breaking Bad did something those iconic shows didnâ€™t do. Show runner Vince Gilligan set his protagonist in motion. Television had always been about a kind of inertia. After every episode of M*A*S*H or The Rockford Files thereâ€™d be a cosmic reset button that would allow the characters to return to exactly where they started at the beginning of the episode. Thatâ€™s how you can make the Korean War last eleven years. And as that first generation of shows from televisionâ€™s post-millennial Golden Era threw off so many of the shackles of convention inherent in the medium, they kept this one. Tony Soprano was a man who didnâ€™t change, couldnâ€™t change. Jimmy Mac-Nu, Stringer Bell and other characters of The Wire fought hard for changeâ€”changing themselves and changing the systemâ€”but Simonâ€™s message was that the drug/cop/court/prison/politics system in a fictionalized Baltimore was, tragically,  too big and too strong to be taken down by a few angry men and women. Vince Gilligan started Breaking Bad with no such constraints. Whereas Tony Soprano spent seven seasons running errands around North Jersey, Walter White embarked on an epic journey, tracing an arc reserved for iconic characters of literature and cinema like Jay Gatsby and Michael Corleone. As he morphed Mr. Chips into Scar face, Gilligan wrote his own version of The Great American Novel. On Steroids. Part of Breaking Badâ€™s grandeur stems from the medium itself. Watching The Godfather Part I and Part II takes about six and a half hours. You can read The Great Gatsby in roughly the same amount of time. When itâ€™s over, Breaking Bad will span 62 episodes. Weâ€™ll have spent almost ten times as much time with Walt and Jesse and Sky as we did with Gatsby and Daisy or Michael Corleone and Tom Hag. We know Walter White in a way that few great characters have ever been known, coming to that knowledge organically, over time. But we spent that same kind of time with Tony Soprano and Mac-Nu. Breaking Bad differs from those shows--and surpasses them--in one important way. This is a story thatâ€™s moving toward an ending. The ending of The Sopranos, whether you loved it or hated it, was largely a non-ending. It was designed to make us think about the show and the act of watching it, as much as it made us think about Tony Soprano. The last season of The Wire, despite a number of resonant, even heartbreaking moments featuring Michael, Omar, and Bubbles, was simply not up to the standards of the four seasons that came before. Deadwood didn't have a proper series finale at all. For all their cardinal virtues, those other contenders for the Best Show Ever left us feeling somewhat unsatisfied\n",
